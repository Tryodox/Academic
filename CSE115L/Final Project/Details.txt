Project Background and Context:


With rising cyber threats, weak passwords are a major vulnerability. Many users reuse 
compromised or simple passwords. This project addresses this issue by creating a tool
that analyzes password strength, checks for breached passwords, and generates secure 
ones. 
 

Project Objectives and Scope: 
Objectives: 

•	Analyze passwords for strength and breaches 
•	Generate secure passwords 
•	Maintain activity logs for both actions 

Scope: 

•	Command-line C application 
•	Reads from breached password file 
•	Stores analysis and generation history with timestamps 
•	Designed for general users and basic cyber awareness 
  
 
 
Technical Approach and Solution 

Key concepts: 
•	Password Analysis: 

o	Checks password length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols) 
o	Calculates entropy to estimate crack time o Compares against a breach list loaded 
from a file 

•	Password Generation: 

o	Generates secure passwords using a randomized character set 
o	User defines desired length 

•	Logging & File I/O: 

o	Stores history of password generations and analysis in separate .txt files with date 
and time 
o	Breached passwords are read from an external file into an array 


Concepts Used: 

•	Conditional Statements, Loops, Functions 
•	Arrays, Strings, Structures 
•	File I/O for reading/writing data
